## 🚀 Core Features

### 🛡️ Intellectual Property & Security

* **Blockchain Verification:** Integrated blockchain logic to timestamp and verify the authenticity of expert answers, ensuring a "Single Source of Truth."
* **Digital Watermarking:** Automatic embedding of unique identifiers in shared documents/resources to prevent unauthorized redistribution of academic content.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Tiered access for Students, Experts, and Admins to maintain platform integrity.

### 🎮 Gamification & Engagement

* **Real-time Leaderboards:** A dynamic ranking system that rewards top contributors based on answer accuracy and community upvotes.
* **Achievement Badges:** Automated badge issuance for hitting milestones (e.g., "Top Solver," "Verified Researcher").
* **Live Query Resolution:** Seamless user interaction flow for posting questions and receiving real-time notifications via Firebase integration.

### 💻 Seamless User Experience

* **Secure Backend Access:** Hardened RESTful APIs with multi-layer authentication to protect user data and interaction history.
* **Responsive Dashboards:** Intuitive interface for tracking posted queries, saved answers, and personal reputation points.

## 📊 Impact & Innovation

* **Trust Economy:** Solves the "fake info" problem in academic forums by providing a verified layer of expert content.
* **Developer Efficiency:** Built using a clean MVC pattern, making the backend highly scalable for high-concurrency query traffic.
* **Data Integrity:** Robust validation schemas ensure that only high-quality, formatted academic data enters the ecosystem.

## 💡 Key Learnings

* **Web3 Integration:** Gained hands-on experience in merging traditional MERN stack workflows with blockchain-based verification logic.
* **Real-time State Management:** Mastered the synchronization of complex UI states across multiple users during live query sessions.
* **Advanced Security:** Deep-dived into digital watermarking techniques and secure API routing to protect intellectual assets.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
